•	Title of the project: James' Portfolio
•	Description of the project: This project is the portfolio of James Visser. I created this project to demonstrate my coding abilities I learned while attending the Full Stack Developer Program at MIT xPro. This Project was created with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and BootStrap. The Project has navigational links and menu bars to connect to internal and external information. The page has various information points describing content and navigations. The program also has illustrations and embedded applications. The Illustrations were done by James Visser through Adobe Illustrator. 
•	How to Run: This project will run on load up. The project also has linking buttons to navigate through different external and internal links. Some links create a new tab to display the application in real time. 
•	Roadmap of future improvements: In the future this page will be imbedded into a portfolio mega page and have links to its repository on GitHub. 
•	License information: This project is for educational purposes and to be displayed on a portfolio to check policies, and MIT licensing procedures or other information please refer to the TLO Technology Licensing Office. Links found below.
